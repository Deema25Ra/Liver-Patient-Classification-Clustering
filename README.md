# Liver Disease Prediction: Classification and Clustering

## Overview
This project involves predicting liver disease in patients from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India, based on clinical and demographic features using classification techniques. Additionally, exploratory analysis may include uncovering natural groupings or clusters among patients, shedding light on potential subgroups within the dataset. The comprehensive dataset encompasses records of both liver and non-liver patients.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and is available at [Indian Liver Patient Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/indian-liver-patient?resource=download).
### Features
- Total Bilirubin
- Direct Bilirubin
- Alkaline Phosphatase
- Alamine Aminotransferase
- Aspartate Aminotransferase
- Total Proteins
- Albumin
- Globulin Ratio

### Target
- Liver Problem

## Motivation
Increased liver disease incidence requires early diagnosis. We aim to understand the relationship between clinical measures and liver disease, predicting new cases faster.

## Tasks
1. **Classification:**
   - Predict liver problem into {liver patient, not liver patient}.
   
2. **Clustering:**
   - Identify distinct clusters within the dataset.
